# AI Prompts Used for Development

**Agent**: Gemini CLI - Antigravity
**Platform**: Google Gemini Advanced

## Prompt 1 (Initial Request)

```
@[Django Assessment.pdf] it's a assessment, implement it following industry standards and best practices
```

This was the initial prompt that included the PDF assessment document. The AI agent:
1. Extracted text from the PDF to understand requirements
2. Created a comprehensive implementation plan
3. Identified the need for PostgreSQL and Redis
4. Designed the architecture for atomic, thread-safe transfers

## Prompt 2 (Environment Setup)

```
no, i don't have PostgreSQL and Redis
```

The AI agent then:
1. Attempted to install PostgreSQL and Redis via winget
2. Successfully installed Redis
3. PostgreSQL installation faced 403 errors, requiring manual installation

## Prompt 3 (Continue After Manual Setup)

```
i configured PostgresSQL manually, created database with name 'assessment' update configurations in settings.py, i also updated postgreeSQL version to 18, you were using 16

continue implementation
```

The AI agent then proceeded to:
1. Create all project files (models, views, serializers, tasks)
2. Set up Celery configuration
3. Write comprehensive test suites
4. Create documentation

---

## Summary

The prompts were **atomic** - each prompt was minimal and focused:
1. Initial request with the assessment document
2. Environment clarification
3. Manual setup notification and continue

The AI agent handled the **molecular** complexity internally by:
- Breaking down the assessment requirements into subtasks
- Creating a structured implementation plan
- Implementing thread-safety with `select_for_update`
- Writing comprehensive tests including concurrency tests
- Generating all documentation
